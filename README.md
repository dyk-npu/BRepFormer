# BRepFormer: Transformer-Based B-rep Geometric Feature Recognition

This repository contains the official implementation of **BRepFormer**, a novel transformer-based approach for geometric feature recognition from Boundary Representation (B-rep) models. BRepFormer leverages the power of attention mechanisms to effectively capture structural and geometric relationships in CAD models, enabling robust and accurate feature recognition.

> **Note**: This project is under active development. Documentation, examples, and additional features are being continuously updated.
